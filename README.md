# Progressor
mark the progress when you develop a project

Progressor is a platform like the Github, which can mark the progress of project. 
I found that Github can not printf Chinese, so i want to develop a new platform face to Chinese developer and project manager.

At the same time, I have a project of develop an app-translater(It should be a funtion of OCR, I can scan a picture by this software and transmit to What I can read-My local language), I can use the progressor to mark down this progress. This is my first target.
